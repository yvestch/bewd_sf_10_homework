This is the repository where you'll put your homework.

How To Use This Repo
---------------------

Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/projects``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```BEWD_SF_10_homework``` folder using your real name and github account name, like ```BEWD_SF_9_homework/KishaRichardson-kisha```. That will make it easier for us to remember who everyone's github name is. :)
